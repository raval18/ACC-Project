Previous Next ? The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative, fixed, absolute or sticky). The position Property The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element. There are five different position values: static relative fixed absolute sticky Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. However, these properties will not work unless the position property is set first. They also work differently depending on the position value. position: static; HTML elements are positioned static by default. Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties. An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page: This <div> element has position: static; Here is the CSS that is used: Example div.static {   position: static;   border: 3px solid #73AD21; } Try it Yourself » position: relative; An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position. Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element. This <div> element has position: relative; Here is the CSS that is used: Example div.relative {   position: relative;   left: 30px;   border: 3px solid #73AD21; } Try it Yourself » position: fixed; An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element. A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located. Notice the fixed element in the lower-right corner of the page. Here is the CSS that is used: Example div.fixed {   position: fixed;   bottom: 0;   right: 0;   width: 300px;   border: 3px solid #73AD21; } Try it Yourself » This <div> element has position: fixed; position: absolute; An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed). However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling. Note: Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements. Here is a simple example: This <div> element has position: relative; This <div> element has position: absolute; Here is the CSS that is used: Example div.relative {   position: relative;   width: 400px;   height: 200px;   border: 3px solid #73AD21; } div.absolute {   position: absolute;   top: 80px;   right: 0;   width: 200px;   height: 100px;   border: 3px solid #73AD21; } Try it Yourself » position: sticky; An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position. A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed). Note: Internet Explorer does not support sticky positioning. Safari requires a -webkit- prefix (see example below). You must also specify at least one of top, right, bottom or left for sticky positioning to work. In this example, the sticky element sticks to the top of the page (top: 0), when you reach its scroll position. Example div.sticky {   position: -webkit-sticky; /* Safari */   position: sticky;   top: 0;   background-color: green;   border: 2px solid #4CAF50; } Try it Yourself » Positioning Text In an Image How to position text over an image: Example Bottom Left Top Left Top Right Bottom Right Centered Try it Yourself: Top Left » Top Right » Bottom Left » Bottom Right » Centered » More Examples Set the shape of an element This example demonstrates how to set the shape of an element. The element is clipped into this shape, and displayed. Test Yourself With Exercises Exercise: Position the <h1> element to always be 50px from the top, and 10px from the right, relative to the window/frame edges. 
<style>
h1 {
  : ;
  : 50px;
  : 10px;
}
</style>

<body>
  <h1>This is a heading</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph</p>
