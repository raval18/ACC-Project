Artificial Intelligence Artificial Intelligence suggest that machines can mimic humans in: Talking Thinking Learning Planning Understanding Human Intelligence About 70 000 years ago, the human brain started to develop "Cognitive Intelligence": Being able to understand numbers Being able to understand a language Being able to understand abstract thinking Languages Cognitive intelligence created: Mind Words Numbers Numbers Cognitive intelligence also created: Numbers Counting Calculating Computers AI is a result of the human need for doing Complex Calculations. This can only be achieved using high speed computers. Mathematics The main branches of Mathematics involved in AI are: Linear Functions Linear Graphics Linear Algebra Probability Statistics These chapters provide content about the branches of mathematics that is used in data science projects (machine learning / deep learning). Linear Algebra AI experts cannot live without this Algebra: AI make use of Scalars AI make use of Vectors AI make use of Matrices AI make use of Tensors Linear Grapics Linear means straight A linear graph is a straight line In general, a linear graph displays a Linear Function Probability Probability is about how likely something is Probability is a number between 0 and 1 Statistics How to collect, analyze, interpret, and present data.
