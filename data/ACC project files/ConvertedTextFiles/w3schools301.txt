Previous Next ? Plug-ins are computer programs that extend the standard functionality of the browser. Plug-ins Plug-ins were designed to be used for many different purposes: To run Java applets To run Microsoft ActiveX controls To display Flash movies To display maps To scan for viruses To verify a bank id Warning !

The <object> Element The <object> element is supported by all browsers. The <object> element defines an embedded object within an HTML document. It was designed to embed plug-ins (like Java applets, PDF readers, and Flash Players) in web pages, but can also be used to include HTML in HTML: Example <object width="100%" height="500px" data="snippet.html"></object> Try it Yourself » Or images if you like: Example <object data="audi.jpeg"></object> Try it Yourself » The <embed> Element The <embed> element is supported in all major browsers. The <embed> element also defines an embedded object within an HTML document. Web browsers have supported the <embed> element for a long time. However, it has not been a part of the HTML specification before HTML5. Example <embed src="audi.jpeg"> Try it Yourself » Note that the <embed> element does not have a closing tag. It can not contain alternative text. The <embed> element can also be used to include HTML in HTML: Example <embed width="100%" height="500px" src="snippet.html"> Try it Yourself » ? Previous Next ?
