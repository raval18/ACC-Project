AppML HTML Attributes Example <div appml-include-html="inc_header.htm"></div> <h1>Customers</h1> <table appml-data="customers.js" appml-controller="myController">   <tr>     <th>Customer</th>     <th>City</th>     <th>Country</th>   </tr>   <tr appml-repeat="records">     <td>{{CustomerName}}</td>     <td>{{City}}</td>     <td>{{Country}}</td>   </tr> </table> <div appml-include-html="inc_footer.htm"></div> Try It Yourself » Attribute Description Explained appml-controller Defines an AppML controller AppML Controllers appml-data Defines the data source for an application AppML Data appml-include-html Defines HTML to be included AppML Includes appml-repeat Defines an HTML element to be repeated AppML Howto AppML Messages Example function myController($appml) {     if ($appml.message == "display") {         if ($appml.display.name == "CustomerName") {             $appml.display.value = $appml.display.value.toUpperCase();         }     } } Try It Yourself » Message Sent ready After AppML is initiated, and ready to load data. loaded After AppML is fully loaded, ready to display data. display Before AppML displays a data item. done After AppML is done (finished displaying). submit Before AppML submits data. error After AppML has encountered an error. AppML messages are explained in the chapter about AppML messages. AppML Models Example { "security": "admin", "rowsperpage" : 10, "database": {     "connection": "mysql",     "sql"       : "SELECT * FROM Customers",     "orderby"   : "CustomerName"}}, "filteritems" : [     {"item" : "CustomerName", "label" : "Customer"},     {"item" : "City"},     {"item" : "Country"}], "sortitems" : [     {"item" : "CustomerName", "label" : "Customer"},     {"item" : "City"},     {"item" : "Country"}] } AppML Model Properties Element Description "data" Defines a flat file source for the model "database" Defines a database source for the model "filteritems" Defines filter restrictions "rowsperpage" Defines number of rows to be fetched per page "security" Defines the security for the model "sortitems" Defines sorting restrictions Application Security You have to be logged in as a member of the "admin" group, to access this application: Example { "security": "admin", "database": {     "connection": "mysql",     "sql"       : "SELECT * FROM Customers",     "orderby"   : "CustomerName"} } Private Models You can add your own private data to the model. This example suggests restrictions to data: Example "restrictions" : {     "fname" : {"maxlength": 40},     "price" : {"max": 999,"min": 100}     } Model data can be used by server applications, and by your AppML controller. This example uses model data to validate input: Example function myController($appml) {     if ($appml.message == "submit") {         var price = document.getElementById("price").value;         if (price < $appml.model.restrictions.price.min) {             $appml.displayError(15, "Price too low!");             return;         } } ?
