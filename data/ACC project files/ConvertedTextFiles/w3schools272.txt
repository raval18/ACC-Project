Previous Next ? Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is. There are two display values: block and inline. Block-level Elements A block-level element always starts on a new line. A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can). A block level element has a top and a bottom margin, whereas an inline element does not. The <div> element is a block-level element. Example <div>Hello World</div> Try it Yourself » Here are the block-level elements in HTML: <address> <article> <aside> <blockquote> <canvas> <dd> <div> <dl> <dt> <fieldset> <figcaption> <figure> <footer> <form> <h1>-<h6> <header> <hr> <li> <main> <nav> <noscript> <ol> <p> <pre> <section> <table> <tfoot> <ul> <video> Inline Elements An inline element does not start on a new line. An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary. This is a <span> element inside a paragraph. Example <span>Hello World</span> Try it Yourself » Here are the inline elements in HTML: <a> <abbr> <acronym> <b> <bdo> <big> <br> <button> <cite> <code> <dfn> <em> <i> <img> <input> <kbd> <label> <map> <object> <output> <q> <samp> <script> <select> <small> <span> <strong> <sub> <sup> <textarea> <time> <tt> <var> Note: An inline element cannot contain a block-level element! The <div> Element The <div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements. The <div> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common. When used together with CSS, the <div> element can be used to style blocks of content: Example <div style="background-color:black;color:white;padding:20px;">   <h2>London</h2>   <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p> </div> Try it Yourself » The <span> Element The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document. The <span> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common. When used together with CSS, the <span> element can be used to style parts of the text: Example <p>My mother has <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">blue</span> eyes and my father has <span style="color:darkolivegreen;font-weight:bold">dark green</span> eyes.</p> Try it Yourself » Chapter Summary There are two display values: block and inline A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available An inline element does not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width as necessary The <div> element is a block-level and is often used as a container for other HTML elements The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document HTML Tags Tag Description <div> Defines a section in a document (block-level) <span> Defines a section in a document (inline) For a complete list of all available HTML tags, visit our HTML Tag Reference. ?
