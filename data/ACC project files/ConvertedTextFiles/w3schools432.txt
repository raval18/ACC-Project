Previous Next ? CSS Transitions CSS transitions allows you to change property values smoothly, over a given duration. Mouse over the element below to see a CSS transition effect: CSS In this chapter you will learn about the following properties: transition transition-delay transition-duration transition-property transition-timing-function Browser Support for Transitions The numbers in the table specify the first browser version that fully supports the property. Property transition 26.0 10.0 16.0 6.1 12.1 transition-delay 26.0 10.0 16.0 6.1 12.1 transition-duration 26.0 10.0 16.0 6.1 12.1 transition-property 26.0 10.0 16.0 6.1 12.1 transition-timing-function 26.0 10.0 16.0 6.1 12.1 How to Use CSS Transitions? To create a transition effect, you must specify two things: the CSS property you want to add an effect to the duration of the effect Note: If the duration part is not specified, the transition will have no effect, because the default value is 0. The following example shows a 100px * 100px red <div> element. The <div> element has also specified a transition effect for the width property, with a duration of 2 seconds: Example div {   width: 100px;   height: 100px;   background: red;   transition: width 2s; } The transition effect will start when the specified CSS property (width) changes value. Now, let us specify a new value for the width property when a user mouses over the <div> element: Example div:hover {   width: 300px; } Try it Yourself » Notice that when the cursor mouses out of the element, it will gradually change back to its original style. Change Several Property Values The following example adds a transition effect for both the width and height property, with a duration of 2 seconds for the width and 4 seconds for the height: Example div {   transition: width 2s, height 4s; } Try it Yourself » Specify the Speed Curve of the Transition The transition-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the transition effect. The transition-timing-function property can have the following values: ease - specifies a transition effect with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default) linear - specifies a transition effect with the same speed from start to end ease-in - specifies a transition effect with a slow start ease-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow end ease-in-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow start and end cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function The following example shows some of the different speed curves that can be used: Example #div1 {transition-timing-function: linear;} #div2 {transition-timing-function: ease;} #div3 {transition-timing-function: ease-in;} #div4 {transition-timing-function: ease-out;} #div5 {transition-timing-function: ease-in-out;} Try it Yourself » Delay the Transition Effect The transition-delay property specifies a delay (in seconds) for the transition effect. The following example has a 1 second delay before starting: Example div {   transition-delay: 1s; } Try it Yourself » Transition + Transformation The following example adds a transition effect to the transformation: Example div {   transition: width 2s, height 2s, transform 2s; } Try it Yourself » More Transition Examples The CSS transition properties can be specified one by one, like this: Example div {   transition-property: width;   transition-duration: 2s;   transition-timing-function: linear;   transition-delay: 1s; } Try it Yourself » or by using the shorthand property transition: Example div {   transition: width 2s linear 1s; } Try it Yourself » Test Yourself With Exercises Exercise: Add a 2 second transition effect for width changes of the <div> element. 
<style>
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background: red;
  : ;
}

div:hover {
  width: 300px;
}
</style>

<body>
  <div>This is a div</div>
</body>
 Submit Answer » Start the Exercise CSS Transition Properties The following table lists all the CSS transition properties: Property Description transition A shorthand property for setting the four transition properties into a single property transition-delay Specifies a delay (in seconds) for the transition effect transition-duration Specifies how many seconds or milliseconds a transition effect takes to complete transition-property Specifies the name of the CSS property the transition effect is for transition-timing-function Specifies the speed curve of the transition effect ?
