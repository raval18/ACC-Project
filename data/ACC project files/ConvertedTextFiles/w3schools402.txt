Previous Next ? What are Pseudo-Elements? A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element. For example, it can be used to: Style the first letter, or line, of an element Insert content before, or after, the content of an element Syntax The syntax of pseudo-elements: selector::pseudo-element {   property: value; } The ::first-line Pseudo-element The ::first-line pseudo-element is used to add a special style to the first line of a text. The following example formats the first line of the text in all <p> elements: Example  p::first-line {   color: #ff0000;   font-variant: small-caps; } Try it Yourself » Note: The ::first-line pseudo-element can only be applied to block-level elements. The following properties apply to the ::first-line pseudo-element: font properties color properties background properties word-spacing letter-spacing text-decoration vertical-align text-transform line-height clear Notice the double colon notation - ::first-line versus :first-line The double colon replaced the single-colon notation for pseudo-elements in CSS3. This was an attempt from W3C to distinguish between pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements. The single-colon syntax was used for both pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements in CSS2 and CSS1. For backward compatibility, the single-colon syntax is acceptable for CSS2 and CSS1 pseudo-elements. The ::first-letter Pseudo-element The ::first-letter pseudo-element is used to add a special style to the first letter of a text. The following example formats the first letter of the text in all <p> elements:  Example p::first-letter {   color: #ff0000;   font-size: xx-large; } Try it Yourself » Note: The ::first-letter pseudo-element can only be applied to block-level elements. The following properties apply to the ::first-letter pseudo- element:  font properties color properties  background properties margin properties padding properties border properties text-decoration vertical-align (only if "float" is "none") text-transform line-height float clear Pseudo-elements and HTML Classes Pseudo-elements can be combined with HTML classes:  Example p.intro::first-letter {   color: #ff0000;   font-size: 200%; } Try it Yourself » The example above will display the first letter of paragraphs with class="intro", in red and in a larger size. Multiple Pseudo-elements Several pseudo-elements can also be combined. In the following example, the first letter of a paragraph will be red, in an xx-large font size. The rest of the first line will be blue, and in small-caps. The rest of the paragraph will be the default font size and color: Example p::first-letter {   color: #ff0000;   font-size: xx-large; } p::first-line {   color: #0000ff;   font-variant: small-caps; } Try it Yourself » CSS - The ::before Pseudo-element The ::before pseudo-element can be used to insert some content before the content of an element. The following example inserts an image before the content of each <h1> element: Example h1::before {   content: url(smiley.gif); } Try it Yourself » CSS - The ::after Pseudo-element The ::after pseudo-element can be used to insert some content after the content of an element. The following example inserts an image after the content of each <h1> element: Example h1::after {   content: url(smiley.gif); } Try it Yourself » CSS - The ::marker Pseudo-element The ::marker pseudo-element selects the markers of list items. The following example styles the markers of list items: Example ::marker {   color: red;   font-size: 23px; } Try it Yourself » CSS - The ::selection Pseudo-element The ::selection pseudo-element matches the portion of an element that is selected by a user. The following CSS properties can be applied to ::selection: color, background, cursor, and outline. The following example makes the selected text red on a yellow background: Example ::selection {   color: red;   background: yellow; } Try it Yourself » Test Yourself With Exercises Exercise: Set the background-color to red, of the first line of the paragraph.

<p class="intro">
In my younger and more vulnerable years
my father gave me some advice that I've
been turning over in my mind ever since.
'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,' he told me,
'just remember that all the people in this world
haven't had the advantages that you've had.'
