Example <b>This text is bold</b> Try it Yourself » The HTML <strong> element defines text with strong importance. The content inside is typically displayed in bold. Example <strong>This text is important!</strong> Try it Yourself » HTML <i> and <em> Elements The HTML <i> element defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood. The content inside is typically displayed in italic. Tip: The <i> tag is often used to indicate a technical term, a phrase from another language, a thought, a ship name, etc. Example <i>This text is italic</i> Try it Yourself » The HTML <em> element defines emphasized text. The content inside is typically displayed in italic. Tip: A screen reader will pronounce the words in <em> with an emphasis, using verbal stress. Example <em>This text is emphasized</em> Try it Yourself » HTML <small> Element The HTML <small> element defines smaller text: Example <small>This is some smaller text.</small> Try it Yourself » HTML <mark> Element The HTML <mark> element defines text that should be marked or highlighted: Example <p>Do not forget to buy <mark>milk</mark> today.</p> Try it Yourself » HTML <del> Element The HTML <del> element defines text that has been deleted from a document. Browsers will usually strike a line through deleted text: Example <p>My favorite color is <del>blue</del> red.</p> Try it Yourself » HTML <ins> Element The HTML <ins> element defines a text that has been inserted into a document. Browsers will usually underline inserted text: Example <p>My favorite color is <del>blue</del> <ins>red</ins>.</p> Try it Yourself » HTML <sub> Element The HTML <sub> element defines subscript text. Subscript text appears half a character below the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. Subscript text can be used for chemical formulas, like H2O: Example <p>This is <sub>subscripted</sub> text.</p> Try it Yourself » HTML <sup> Element The HTML <sup> element defines superscript text. Superscript text appears half a character above the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font.
