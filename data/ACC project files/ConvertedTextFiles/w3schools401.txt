Previous Next ? What are Pseudo-classes? A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element. For example, it can be used to: Style an element when a user mouses over it Style visited and unvisited links differently Style an element when it gets focus Mouse Over Me Syntax The syntax of pseudo-classes: selector:pseudo-class {   property: value; } Anchor Pseudo-classes Links can be displayed in different ways: Example /* unvisited link */ a:link {   color: #FF0000; } /* visited link */ a:visited {   color: #00FF00; } /* mouse over link */ a:hover {   color: #FF00FF; } /* selected link */ a:active {   color: #0000FF; } Try it Yourself » Note: a:hover MUST come after a:link and a:visited in the CSS definition in order to be effective! a:active MUST come after a:hover in the CSS definition in order to be effective! Pseudo-class names are not case-sensitive. Pseudo-classes and HTML Classes Pseudo-classes can be combined with HTML classes: When you hover over the link in the example, it will change color: Example a.highlight:hover {   color: #ff0000; } Try it Yourself » Hover on <div> An example of using the :hover pseudo-class on a <div> element: Example div:hover {   background-color: blue; } Try it Yourself » Simple Tooltip Hover Hover over a <div> element to show a <p> element (like a tooltip): Hover over me to show the <p> element. Tada! Here I am! Example p {   display: none;   background-color: yellow;   padding: 20px; } div:hover p {   display: block; } Try it Yourself » CSS - The :first-child Pseudo-class The :first-child pseudo-class matches a specified element that is the first child of another element. Match the first <p> element In the following example, the selector matches any <p> element that is the first child of any element: Example p:first-child {   color: blue; } Try it Yourself » Match the first <i> element in all <p> elements In the following example, the selector matches the first <i> element in all <p> elements: Example p i:first-child {   color: blue; } Try it Yourself » Match all <i> elements in all first child <p> elements In the following example, the selector matches all <i> elements in <p> elements that are the first child of another element: Example p:first-child i {   color: blue; } Try it Yourself » CSS - The :lang Pseudo-class The :lang pseudo-class allows you to define special rules for different languages. In the example below, :lang defines the quotation marks for <q> elements with lang="no": Example <html> <head> <style> q:lang(no) {   quotes: "~" "~"; } </style> </head> <body> <p>Some text <q lang="no">A quote in a paragraph</q> Some text.</p> </body> </html> Try it Yourself » More Examples Add different styles to hyperlinks This example demonstrates how to add other styles to hyperlinks. Use of :focus This example demonstrates how to use the :focus pseudo-class. Test Yourself With Exercises Exercise: Set the background-color to red, when you mouse over a link. 
<style>
 {
  background-color: red;
}
</style>

<body>

<h1>This is a header.</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<a href="https://w3schools.com">This is a link.</a>

</body>
