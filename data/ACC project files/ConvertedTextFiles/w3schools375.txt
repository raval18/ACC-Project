Previous Next ? What are Web Safe Fonts? Web safe fonts are fonts that are universally installed across all browsers and devices. Fallback Fonts However, there are no 100% completely web safe fonts. There is always a chance that a font is not found or is not installed properly. Therefore, it is very important to always use fallback fonts. This means that you should add a list of similar "backup fonts" in the font-family property. If the first font does not work, the browser will try the next one, and the next one, and so on. Always end the list with a generic font family name. Example Here, there are three font types: Tahoma, Verdana, and sans-serif. The second and third fonts are backups, in case the first one is not found. p { font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, sans-serif; } Try it Yourself » Best Web Safe Fonts for HTML and CSS The following list are the best web safe fonts for HTML and CSS: Arial (sans-serif) Verdana (sans-serif) Helvetica (sans-serif) Tahoma (sans-serif) Trebuchet MS (sans-serif) Times New Roman (serif) Georgia (serif) Garamond (serif) Courier New (monospace) Brush Script MT (cursive) Note: Before you publish your website, always check how your fonts appear on different browsers and devices, and always use fallback fonts!
