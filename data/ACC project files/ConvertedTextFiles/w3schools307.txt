Previous Next ? Server-Sent Events (SSE) allow a web page to get updates from a server. Server-Sent Events - One Way Messaging A server-sent event is when a web page automatically gets updates from a server. This was also possible before, but the web page would have to ask if any updates were available. With server-sent events, the updates come automatically. Examples: Facebook/Twitter updates, stock price updates, news feeds, sport results, etc. Browser Support The numbers in the table specify the first browser version that fully support server-sent events. API SSE 6.0 79.0 6.0 5.0 11.5 Receive Server-Sent Event Notifications The EventSource object is used to receive server-sent event notifications: Example var source = new EventSource("demo_sse.php"); source.onmessage = function(event) {   document.getElementById("result").innerHTML += event.data + "<br>"; }; Try it Yourself » Example explained: Create a new EventSource object, and specify the URL of the page sending the updates (in this example "demo_sse.php") Each time an update is received, the onmessage event occurs When an onmessage event occurs, put the received data into the element with id="result" Check Server-Sent Events Support In the tryit example above there were some extra lines of code to check browser support for server-sent events: if(typeof(EventSource) !== "undefined") {   // Yes! Server-sent events support!   // Some code..... } else {   // Sorry! No server-sent events support.. } Server-Side Code Example For the example above to work, you need a server capable of sending data updates (like PHP or ASP). The server-side event stream syntax is simple. Set the "Content-Type" header to "text/event-stream". Now you can start sending event streams. Code in PHP (demo_sse.php): <?php header('Content-Type: text/event-stream'); header('Cache-Control: no-cache'); $time = date('r'); echo "data: The server time is: {$time}\n\n"; flush(); ?> Code in ASP (VB) (demo_sse.asp): <% Response.ContentType = "text/event-stream" Response.Expires = -1 Response.Write("data: The server time is: " & now()) Response.Flush() %> Code explained: Set the "Content-Type" header to "text/event-stream" Specify that the page should not cache Output the data to send (Always start with "data: ") Flush the output data back to the web page The EventSource Object In the examples above we used the onmessage event to get messages. But other events are also available: Events Description onopen When a connection to the server is opened onmessage When a message is received onerror When an error occurs ? Previous Next ?
