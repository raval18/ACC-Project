Previous Next ? A paragraph always starts on a new line, and is usually a block of text. HTML Paragraphs The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph. A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph. Example <p>This is a paragraph.</p> <p>This is another paragraph.</p> Try it Yourself » HTML Display You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed. Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results. With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code. The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed: Example <p> This paragraph contains a lot of lines in the source code, but the browser ignores it. </p> <p> This paragraph contains         a lot of spaces in the source         code, but the        browser ignores it. </p> Try it Yourself » HTML Horizontal Rules The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule. The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page: Example <h1>This is heading 1</h1> <p>This is some text.</p> <hr> <h2>This is heading 2</h2> <p>This is some other text.</p> <hr> Try it Yourself » The <hr> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag. HTML Line Breaks The HTML <br> element defines a line break. Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph: Example <p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p> Try it Yourself » The <br> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag. The Poem Problem This poem will display on a single line: Example <p>   My Bonnie lies over the ocean.   My Bonnie lies over the sea.   My Bonnie lies over the ocean.   Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me. </p> Try it Yourself » Solution - The HTML <pre> Element The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text. The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks: Example <pre>   My Bonnie lies over the ocean.   My Bonnie lies over the sea.   My Bonnie lies over the ocean.   Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me. </pre> Try it Yourself » HTML Exercises Test Yourself With Exercises Exercise: Use the correct HTML tag to add a paragraph with the text "Hello World!". <html> <body> </body> </html> Submit Answer » Start the Exercise HTML Tag Reference W3Schools' tag reference contains additional information about HTML elements and their attributes. Tag Description <p> Defines a paragraph <hr> Defines a thematic change in the content <br> Inserts a single line break <pre> Defines pre-formatted text For a complete list of all available HTML tags, visit our HTML Tag Reference. ?
