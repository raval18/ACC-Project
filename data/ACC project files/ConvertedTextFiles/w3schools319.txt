Previous Next ? HTML Error Messages When a browser requests a service from a web server, an error might occur, and the server might return an error code like "404 Not Found". It is common to name these errors HTML error messages. But these messages are something called HTTP status messages. In fact, the server always returns a message for every request. The most common message is 200 OK. Below is a list of HTTP status messages that might be returned: 1xx: Information Message: Description: 100 Continue The server has received the request headers, and the client should proceed to send the request body 101 Switching Protocols The requester has asked the server to switch protocols 103 Checkpoint Used in the resumable requests proposal to resume aborted PUT or POST requests 2xx: Successful Message: Description: 200 OK The request is OK (this is the standard response for successful HTTP requests) 201 Created The request has been fulfilled, and a new resource is created  202 Accepted The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed 203 Non-Authoritative Information The request has been successfully processed, but is returning information that may be from another source 204 No Content The request has been successfully processed, but is not returning any content 205 Reset Content The request has been successfully processed, but is not returning any content, and requires that the requester reset the document view 206 Partial Content The server is delivering only part of the resource due to a range header sent by the client 3xx: Redirection Message: Description: 300 Multiple Choices A link list. The user can select a link and go to that location. Maximum five addresses   301 Moved Permanently The requested page has moved to a new URL  302 Found The requested page has moved temporarily to a new URL  303 See Other The requested page can be found under a different URL 304 Not Modified Indicates the requested page has not been modified since last requested 306 Switch Proxy No longer used 307 Temporary Redirect The requested page has moved temporarily to a new URL 308 Resume Incomplete Used in the resumable requests proposal to resume aborted PUT or POST requests 4xx: Client Error Message: Description: 400 Bad Request The request cannot be fulfilled due to bad syntax 401 Unauthorized The request was a legal request, but the server is refusing to respond to it. For use when authentication is possible but has failed or not yet been provided 402 Payment Required Reserved for future use 403 Forbidden The request was a legal request, but the server is refusing to respond to it 404 Not Found The requested page could not be found but may be available again in the future 405 Method Not Allowed A request was made of a page using a request method not supported by that page 406 Not Acceptable The server can only generate a response that is not accepted by the client 407 Proxy Authentication Required The client must first authenticate itself with the proxy 408 Request Timeout The server timed out waiting for the request 409 Conflict The request could not be completed because of a conflict in the request 410 Gone The requested page is no longer available 411 Length Required The "Content-Length" is not defined. The server will not accept the request without it  412 Precondition Failed The precondition given in the request evaluated to false by the server 413 Request Entity Too Large The server will not accept the request, because the request entity is too large 414 Request-URI Too Long The server will not accept the request, because the URL is too long.
